# IRod22
Hello everyone, I'm Ivan Rodriguez, and I'm here to think up amazing ideas that the @NodeJS and GitHub community could improve upon.

## What do you mean by "solutions"?
Well, I've been coding since 2020, primarily in JavaScript; since then, I have developed a few projects that can be used for inspiration for other larger projects,
and these projects can push some paradigms to the limit.

## Ok, but why is your [account page](https://www.github.com/IRod22?tab=repositories) only show this repository?
The answer is that I don't feel that my projects are ready for the public world yet. You can see more details on the posts I wrote for
[Github Community](https://github.community/t/a-software-license-for-the-modern-world/259915) and
[Mozilla Discourse](https://discourse.mozilla.org/t/a-software-license-for-the-modern-world/99529).
